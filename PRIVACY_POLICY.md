# Privacy Policy for Cat Scribe

Last updated: February 20, 2026

Cat Scribe is designed to minimize data collection and retention.

## Data We Collect

Cat Scribe does not require account creation and does not collect personal profile data from users.

## Images and Text Processing

When you use text extraction features:

- Captured images are processed on-device where possible.
- If you use cloud AI processing (for example Google Gemini), the selected image content is transmitted to that provider to generate extracted text.
- If you use Apple Vision processing, extraction is performed on-device.

Cat Scribe does not intentionally retain your extracted text or captured images on our servers.

## Data Storage

- API keys you enter are stored locally in iOS Keychain on your device.
- App settings are stored locally on your device.
- Cat Scribe does not operate a backend database for your notebook content.

## Third-Party Services

If enabled by you, Cat Scribe can send content to:

- Google Gemini API (for cloud OCR/text extraction)
- Drafts app (for export workflows)

Use of those services is subject to their own privacy policies and terms.

## Data Sharing and Sale

Cat Scribe does not sell personal information and does not share personal data for advertising purposes.

## Data Retention

Cat Scribe does not maintain a server-side retention system for your notebook images or extracted text.

## Children

Cat Scribe is not directed to children under 13.

## Security

We use platform security features such as iOS Keychain and HTTPS for network communication where applicable.
